## Trace
```python
Trace(inputs:Union[NoneType, str, Iterable[str]]=None, outputs:Union[NoneType, str, Iterable[str]]=None, mode:Union[NoneType, str, Iterable[str]]=None) -> None
```
Trace controls the training loop. Users can use the `Trace` base class to customize their own functionality.

Traces are invoked by the fe.Estimator periodically as it runs. In addition to the current data dictionary, they are
also given a pointer to the current `System` instance which allows access to more information as well as giving the
ability to modify or even cancel training. The order of function invocations is as follows:

#### Args:

* **inputs** :  A set of keys that this trace intends to read from the state dictionary as inputs.
* **outputs** :  A set of keys that this trace intends to write into the system buffer.
* **mode** :  What mode(s) to execute this Trace in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute        regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an argument        like "!infer" or "!train".

### on_batch_begin
```python
on_batch_begin(self, data:fastestimator.util.data.Data) -> None
```
Runs at the beginning of each batch.


#### Args:

* **data** :  A dictionary through which traces can communicate with each other or write values for logging.

### on_batch_end
```python
on_batch_end(self, data:fastestimator.util.data.Data) -> None
```
Runs at the end of each batch.


#### Args:

* **data** :  The current batch and prediction data, as well as any information written by prior `Traces`.

### on_begin
```python
on_begin(self, data:fastestimator.util.data.Data) -> None
```
Runs once at the beginning of training or testing.


#### Args:

* **data** :  A dictionary through which traces can communicate with each other or write values for logging.

### on_end
```python
on_end(self, data:fastestimator.util.data.Data) -> None
```
Runs once at the end training.


#### Args:

* **data** :  A dictionary through which traces can communicate with each other or write values for logging.

### on_epoch_begin
```python
on_epoch_begin(self, data:fastestimator.util.data.Data) -> None
```
Runs at the beginning of each epoch.


#### Args:

* **data** :  A dictionary through which traces can communicate with each other or write values for logging.

### on_epoch_end
```python
on_epoch_end(self, data:fastestimator.util.data.Data) -> None
```
Runs at the end of each epoch.


#### Args:

* **data** :  A dictionary through which traces can communicate with each other or write values for logging.
