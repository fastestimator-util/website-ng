### sort_traces
```python
sort_traces(
	traces: List[trace.trace.Trace],
	available_outputs: Union[Set[str], NoneType]=None
)
-> List[trace.trace.Trace]
```
Sort traces to attempt to resolve any dependency issues.

This is essentially a topological sort, but it doesn't seem worthwhile to convert the data into a graph
representation in order to get the slightly better asymptotic runtime complexity.


#### Args:

* **traces** :  A list of traces (not inside schedulers) to be sorted.
* **available_outputs** :  What output keys are already available for the traces to use. If None are provided, the        sorting algorithm will assume that any keys not generated by traces are being provided by the system.        This results in a less rigorous sorting.

#### Returns:
    The sorted list of `traces`.

#### Raises:

* **AssertionError** :  If Traces have circular dependencies or require input keys which are not available.
