Minmax(*args, **kwargs)
```

* **outputs** :  Key(s) into which to write the modified images.
* **mode** :  What mode(s) to execute this Op in. For example, "train", "eval", "test", or "infer". To execute        regardless of mode, pass None. To execute in all modes except for a particular one, you can pass an argument        like "!infer" or "!train".
