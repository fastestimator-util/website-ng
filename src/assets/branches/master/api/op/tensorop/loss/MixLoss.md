## MixLoss
```python
MixLoss(loss:fastestimator.op.tensorop.loss.loss.LossOp, lam:str, average_loss:bool=True)
```
Loss class to compute mixiup and cutmix losses.

This class should be used in conjunction with MixUpBatch and CutMixBatch to perform mix-up training, which helps to
reduce over-fitting, stabilize GAN training, and harden against adversarial attacks. See
https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412 for details.


#### Args:

* **loss** :  A loss object which we use to calculate the underlying loss of MixLoss. This should be an object of type        fe.op.tensorop.loss.loss.LossOp.
* **lam** :  The key of the lambda value generated by MixUpBatch or CutMixBatch.
* **average_loss** :  Whether the final loss should be averaged or not.

#### Raises:

* **ValueError** :  If the provided `loss` has multiple outputs.
