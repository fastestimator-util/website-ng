```python
MixLoss(
	loss: fastestimator.op.tensorop.loss.loss.LossOp,
	lam: str,
	average_loss: bool=True
)
```
Loss class to compute mix-up and cutmix losses.

This class should be used in conjunction with MixUpBatch and CutMixBatch to perform mix-up training, which helps to
reduce over-fitting, stabilize GAN training, and harden against adversarial attacks. See
https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412 for details.


<h3>Args:</h3>


* **loss**: A loss object which we use to calculate the underlying loss of MixLoss. This should be an object of type fe.op.tensorop.loss.loss.LossOp.

* **lam**: The key of the lambda value generated by MixUpBatch or CutMixBatch.

* **average_loss**: Whether the final loss should be averaged or not. 

<h3>Raises:</h3>


* **ValueError**: If the provided `loss` has multiple outputs.
